The plugin integrates PayU Poland payments with Sylius based applications.

> For the plugin to work correctly, `base currency` should be set to `Polish Zloty` in the Sylius admin panel.

After an installation, user should be able to create new PayU payment method in the "Payment methods" section in the admin panel.
